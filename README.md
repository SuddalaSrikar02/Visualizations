🎯 Power BI Visualization Practice — Day’s Learning Recap
Today’s session focused on building insightful dashboards in Microsoft Power BI.
 I created visualizations that represent:
 📊 Sum of Salary by Department and Gender using a clustered bar chart to analyze pay distribution.

 🥧 Count of Gender by Employee ID using a pie chart for quick demographic insights.

Through this exercise, I explored:
 ✅ Data visualization techniques
 ✅ Comparative analysis between departments
 ✅ Gender-based insights in organizational data

Excited to keep improving my Power BI and data analytics skills! 🚀

🚀 Data Visualization using Power BI | Turning Data into Insights 🌍📊

Recently, I created an interactive Power BI dashboard that visualizes:

📌 1️⃣ Population Insights – India Map
Displays the sum of population by state and capital, providing a clear regional comparison across India.
Enables quick identification of population-heavy states and their administrative centers.
📌 2️⃣ Global Overview – Country Map
Showcases population (in millions) and total area (sq. km) by country and capital, offering a global perspective of demographic and geographic distribution.
📌 3️⃣ Detailed Tables
Highlights state-wise population, country-wise area, and employee salary summary for better analytical clarity.

💡 This project reflects how data can be beautifully visualized to communicate patterns and insights effectively — combining geography, demographics, and organizational data in one unified dashboard.
